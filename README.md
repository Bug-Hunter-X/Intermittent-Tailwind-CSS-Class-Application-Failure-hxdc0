# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply inconsistently. The issue is not consistent and affects only certain classes, even though the configuration appears correct.

## Bug Description

Tailwind classes sometimes apply correctly, and sometimes do not. There's no clear pattern to why this happens. The HTML structure and Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) have been carefully reviewed and appear to be correct. The issue seems specific to certain classes, with no obvious pattern. The `@tailwind directives` are present in the CSS file and Tailwind is correctly configured and installed.
