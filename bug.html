I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my components.  The HTML structure appeared correct, but the styles weren't rendering.  I've checked my configuration and the `tailwind.config.js` file, and everything seems to be in order. I've also ensured that the Tailwind directives (`@tailwind directives`) are present in my CSS file. The issue only occurs with specific classes and seems random, it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
